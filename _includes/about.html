  <p align="justify">
    Hey there, I&#39;m a Computer Science Engineering student at SRM University, and I&#39;m passionate about coding in Python and exploring the world of Machine Learning. I always look for challenges to test my skills and dive deep into complex projects. My ultimate goal is to develop a deep understanding of Machine Learning and apply it to real-world problems. That&#39;s why I&#39;m always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow in this field.
  I&#39;m excited to pursue a Master&#39;s degree in Applied Data Science to further my knowledge and skills in this area. With this degree, I&#39;ll be better equipped to create innovative solutions that can address real-world challenges. I believe in &quot;CARPE DIEM&quot; and I&#39;m always ready to seize every opportunity that comes my way. With my passion for coding and Machine Learning, I know I can make a positive impact in the world of Computer Science.
